1. Does SNS guarantee exactly-once delivery to subscribers?

No â€” SNS does not guarantee exactly-once delivery.

It guarantees at-least-once delivery.

This means a message will be delivered one or more times, so duplicates are possible (e.g., due to retries, network issues, subscriber unavailability).

If you need exactly-once semantics, you usually combine SNS with SQS FIFO queues or design idempotent consumers so duplicates wonâ€™t cause side effects.

2. What is the purpose of the Dead-letter Queue (DLQ)?

A DLQ is used to capture messages that could not be successfully processed/delivered after a defined number of retries.

For SNS: if a subscriber (e.g., Lambda or SQS) fails consistently, SNS can move the undeliverable messages to a DLQ.

For SQS: if a consumer keeps failing to process a message, SQS moves it to a DLQ after the maximum receive count is exceeded.

For EventBridge: if a target service cannot process the event, the event can be sent to a DLQ.

ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: Prevent message loss, make it easier to debug, inspect, and reprocess problematic messages later.

3. How would you enable a notification to your email when messages are added to the DLQ?

You can chain DLQ â†’ SNS â†’ Email subscription. Steps:

Create an SNS topic (e.g., DLQ-Alerts).

Subscribe your email to the topic (SNS supports email protocol).

Configure the DLQ (SQS) to trigger the SNS topic:

For SQS DLQ: use an SQS â†’ Lambda or SQS â†’ EventBridge rule that forwards new DLQ messages to the SNS topic.

For SNS DLQ: attach an SQS DLQ, then add an EventBridge rule or Lambda to monitor the DLQ and publish to the DLQ-Alerts topic.

This way, every time a message is placed in the DLQ, youâ€™ll get an email alert.
